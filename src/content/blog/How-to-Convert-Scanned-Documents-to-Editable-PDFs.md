In today's digital age, having the ability to edit and manipulate PDF documents is crucial. However, scanned documents often present a challenge as they are essentially images, making them non-editable. This is where Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology comes to the rescue. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of converting scanned documents to editable PDFs using OCR.

## What is OCR?

OCR, or Optical Character Recognition, is a technology that recognizes text within a digital image. It essentially "reads" the text in scanned documents or image files and converts it into machine-readable text that can be edited, searched, and manipulated.

## Steps to Convert Scanned Documents to Editable PDFs

1. **Prepare Your Scanned Document**: Ensure your scanned document is clear and legible. Higher quality scans will yield better OCR results.

2. **Choose an OCR Tool**: There are many OCR tools available, both online and offline. At PDFEquips, we offer a powerful OCR tool designed specifically for this purpose.

3. **Upload Your Document**: Use our [OCR tool](https://www.pdfequips.com/ocr-pdf) to upload your scanned document.


4. **Run OCR**: Once uploaded, initiate the OCR process. Our advanced algorithms will analyze the document and recognize the text.

5. **Review and Edit**: After the OCR process is complete, you'll have an editable PDF. Review the converted text to ensure accuracy and make any necessary edits.

6. **Save Your Editable PDF**: Once you're satisfied with the results, save your newly editable PDF file.

## Benefits of Converting Scanned Documents to Editable PDFs
